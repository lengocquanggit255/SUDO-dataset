44ouncer,Budweiser,65,5,American Adjunct Lager,"Had a couple of 16 ounce cups of this in the stands at the NHRA Winternationals in Pomona, California during Friday qualifying. The kegs must have come out of the brewery the day before and just passed through the distributor on the way to the track -- because this was the freshest, best tasting batch of Bud I've ever had. Real nice golden color. Nice, clean smell -- yet generic as nothing really jumped out. Exceptionally clean taste. No, it isn't a micro by any stretch of the imagination -- but as lagers go, this was right up there with the best of them. The mouthfeel can best be described as sparkling. Again, really clean. As far as drinkability goes, I could have had several more -- but had to lay off because I had a 500 mile drive to San Francisco ahead of me -- and a waistline which is several inches bigger than it was a few years ago.

Actually got yelled at by Fritz Maytag because I was heading toward the employees' bathroom instead of the one for brewery guests. Sorry, Fritz. Appearance a wonderful golden red. Terrific smell -- a terrific blend of all the ingredients. The hops, the malt, everything. A smooth, rich taste, with just enough of a bite to remind you that this is an adult beverage. Not too harsh, though. Pefect. Mouthfeel was very smooth, yet rich. As far as drinkability was concerned, it's a great beer to sit around with family and friends with.

Far too bitter for my taste. Maybe the batch I have needs additional aging, or maybe I just don't care for that much hop flavor. The bitterness is overpowering and should be toned down. Mouthfeel is better than average and the quality ingredients shine through. Chimay is in a slightly different style (Trappist ale) but is widely available and might be a better choice for those interested in getting started with higher gravity brews.

How pleasantly surprised I was when it arrived at the table and was confused as to what type of beer it was as it did not adhere to either style. When I got home, I punched it in at the beeradvocate website and found it was from Rogue, which I haven't been able to get in any of my local stores here in New England. As far as the beer goes, it did not have the metallic taste I associate with other Rogue products I've had. The malt was a honey-ish variety with the hops being ever present but not overtly spicy. The body was nicely constructed, with the head playing a strong part in the experience all the way to the bottom of the glass. If it wasn't for the fact that I was driving, I could easily have sat there and sampled more.

At first I thought it might have been a Helles Bock or something, judging by the title. Anyhow... Off to a bad start when I noticed the face label was on crooked. Plus, the label design is a bit amateurish. This is a good brewery, they could have done better. But, hey, I'm not drinking the label! It poured a pale straw color with slight haze. I'm not sure if it was chill haze, but since lagers are generally served at around 45 deg, there shouldn't be any haze. Not much aroma, though there did seem to be a slight wiff of noble-y hops over a nice malt aromatic. Prevalent malt sweetness, not overpowering, but quite noticeable. The hop bitterness kicks in abruptly at the finish, while the sweetness slowly tapers off. Pleasant aftertaste. Despite it's unconventional flavor profile (seems more like an ale), it is definitely inviting.

Plus, the label design is a bit amateurish. This is a good brewery, they could have done better. But, hey, I'm not drinking the label! It poured a pale straw color with slight haze. I'm not sure if it was chill haze, but since lagers are generally served at around 45 deg, there shouldn't be any haze. Not much aroma, though there did seem to be a slight wiff of noble-y hops over a nice malt aromatic. Prevalent malt sweetness, not overpowering, but quite noticeable.

greencard,Trois Pistoles,30,9,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,"Original review 2-20-2003... Aroma: slight maltiness with some wisps of alcohol, raisins and plums. Appearance: a tawny, reddish-brown, creamy off-white head, some haze (not from chilling). The alcohol content killed the head pretty quickly, even in a clean Chimay glass. Taste/mouthfeel: a lot of alcohol warmth, slight sweetness, a touch of raisins round out the flavor. The high carbonation gives it a nice flavor break, in lieu of hop bitterness or flavor (of which there is little). A fair amount of caramel aftertaste, but also a slight note of sharp bitterness unrelated to hops. Overall: A well-crafted beer. Unibroue has not disappointed me yet. This is a great example of a dubbel/strong dark ale, though I generally like a little more presence of the dark, dried fruit characteristic. I have another bottle of this that I'm going to lay down for a couple of years.

I really enjoy the Belgian White beers, and had high expectations from Celis White. This bottled sample was from the Michigan Brewing Co. At first pour I noticed a terrific aroma and classic color. The carbonation was good. The first sip of this beer was not at all what I had expected. It's much more intense than Hoegaarden, or Blue Moon, but too citrus, and had a zesty sour lemon taste.

Dark night color with a thick head that dissipates quickly - head takes on a tan/dirty cream color leaving some thin lines of stain off of fairly coating lace. Smells of impressive slightly roasted wheat and malt nose that opens to hearty nuttiness. Something else in the nose that i cant describe floral as well as pistachio nut. Some roasted malt on the tongue but mostly a darkened wheat and malt flavor with some creamy tone. The strong point appears to me to be the (seeming) wheatiness that is roasted enough but the pure wheat flavor still exists. Truly, its nothing more than nutty, malty flavors that build on top of each other. You might call it mukry with all those roast and malt flavors, but I find it as delectable, complex, hearty, and drinkable as a doppelbock can get. Sometimes, the bottled version mildly tingles on your tongue, with a taste of a dark cheese with earthy, sour fruitiness to it (?!), but not always.

In all, a wonderful taste: hoppy with a fruity tartness and a touch of spice. Perfect amount of alcohol, and the yeast did not seem to effect the taste when added to the last pour. It went great with my moules that were in wine-cream sauce and my frites with mayo! Truly a unique take on a belgian golden ale that is mixed with some wit characteristics.

Slightly buttery in taste and feel, quite tingly on the tongue, but in all a crisp and clean slide drink. Goldeny flavor that appears as a delicate mix of malt background, light hops, and estery foreground. Unbelievably drinkable regardless of verrry high alcohol content which youll feel warm up your belly - no wonder its name, eh?, Better served on the colder side (starting at 50). Mine came from a newly-filled growler (at Half Time, THE most amazing beer in the Northeast). Many say this is not an outstanding brew, and I believe that's because it's not a knock-out experience on all levels. Important to remember that this beer is supposed to be quiet and not with big flavors: it isnt a sweet and spicy dubbel or a high and complex trippel.

A nice, solid copper defined the appearance in the glass, but a thin head with little to no retention was a disappointment. I sensed a faint, hoppy, floral scent after a little swirling.

Cork was decaying, even after applying standard wine keeping techniques. This forced us to drink the entire bottle in one sitting - damn. (Note 10/10/01: Sam Adams actually recommends that you store SATB upright. The cork is not meant to be soaked, like a wine cork. It's a much softer grade. Unfortunately I found this out after this review.) Three tastings so far # 1 = 01/10/1996 # 2 = 06/29/1996 # 3 = 01/15/1998 Appearance: A deep black syrup that seems to stick to the glass (with a gentle swirl or after a sip). Smell: 1) Powerful alcoholic aromas, slightly pungent of burnt sugar and fruit., 2) Very sweet and rich similar to candied fruit., 3) Dried fruit (raisins) and molasses. Taste: 1) Alcohol was very dominant. Thick and overwhelming in a syrupy caramelized sugar mouth feel and taste. No carbonation detected., 2) Like wine made from raisins. Very complex and interesting. More refined over the previous tasting. You can taste the oak and maple syrup, slightly. 3) Rich maple and molasses sweetness, brandy like in smoothness and consistency, with a slightly woody finish. Notes: 1) Should have waited, but this is how one gauges the growth of a brew. We will try again in 6 months., 2) This brew is definitely beginning to show signs of aging well. Sip and enjoy., 3) This definitely mellows with age, and is meant to be sipped (perhaps after an evening meal or as a nightcap). In 1996 we opened one and the alcohol was too overwhelming, so it is nice to see that this brew has met Jim Koch's expectations of aging well. With its 17%+ alcohol content it holds the title ""the strongest beer"" (up until 1999), and makes for a very warming and savored brew.

Taste: Complex malt richness and fruit flavours, with hints of spice and a smooth body of dark sweetness. Semi-champagne style carbonation led to it finishing slightly dry and yet again ... more sweetness. Notes: This is a victory for American Belgian Ale lovers.

todd,Samuel Adams Triple Bock,111,2025-05-17 00:00:00,American Strong Ale,"Presentation: 8.45oz blue bottle with gold lettering, comes with a very nice brief history of the style and a note from Jim Koch. Cork was decaying, even after applying standard wine keeping techniques. This forced us to drink the entire bottle in one sitting - damn. (Note 10/10/01: Sam Adams actually recommends that you store SATB upright. The cork is not meant to be soaked, like a wine cork. It's a much softer grade. Unfortunately I found this out after this review.) Three tastings so far # 1 = 01/10/1996 # 2 = 06/29/1996 # 3 = 01/15/1998 Appearance: A deep black syrup that seems to stick to the glass (with a gentle swirl or after a sip). Smell: 1) Powerful alcoholic aromas, slightly pungent of burnt sugar and fruit., 2) Very sweet and rich similar to candied fruit., 3) Dried fruit (raisins) and molasses. Taste: 1) Alcohol was very dominant. Thick and overwhelming in a syrupy caramelized sugar mouth feel and taste. No carbonation detected., 2) Like wine made from raisins. Very complex and interesting. More refined over the previous tasting. You can taste the oak and maple syrup, slightly. 3) Rich maple and molasses sweetness, brandy like in smoothness and consistency, with a slightly woody finish. Notes: 1) Should have waited, but this is how one gauges the growth of a brew. We will try again in 6 months., 2) This brew is definitely beginning to show signs of aging well. Sip and enjoy., 3) This definitely mellows with age, and is meant to be sipped (perhaps after an evening meal or as a nightcap). In 1996 we opened one and the alcohol was too overwhelming, so it is nice to see that this brew has met Jim Koch's expectations of aging well. With its 17%+ alcohol content it holds the title ""the strongest beer"" (up until 1999), and makes for a very warming and savored brew. One of the finest and most intriguing domestically brewed barley wines.",3.0,4.0,4.5,4.5,McNeill's Firehouse Amber Ale,325,2025-06-05 00:00:00,American Amber / Red Ale,"Presentation: An old picture of firehouse with a horse drawn water pump surrounded by proud firemen adorns the 12 oz. brown bottle.

The color is traditional among IPA's, pale yet slightly higher in lovibond than a pilsner, noting the use of a crystal malt (probably a 20L-40L). It is incredibly drinkable with a low-med body. This is not one of my favorite beers. It lacks all the key ingredients of a good IPA; elevated alcohol, a strong hop flavor, a strong and destinctive hop aroma . IPA's are supposed to be for the beer snob.They are for people who like hops, not the mainstream Budweiser drinker. Be creative. It looks as though they spent as much time formulating this recipe as they did in creating it's label, which in my opinion is absolutely horrible, especially from a noteworthy brewery such as The Shipyard. ""Two Thumbs Down!""",3.5,3.0,4.5,3.0,Shakespeare Oatmeal Stout,56973,2025-01-06 00:00:00,Oatmeal Stout,"The beer is classic stout color, black, with a dark tan head that when poured dissipates quickly, but remains as a slight ring around the glass. It has a mild citrusy hop aroma (Cascade hops) with dark malt character that blends together nicely. The beer tastes very dark, noting the use of roasted barley and chocolate malts (a little too heavy on the roasted barley). It is also flavored with Cascade hops which gives it a very pleasant hop flavor. It has a med. to heavy body, but is highly drinkable. This is not, in my opinion, one of their better beers, but is still better than many competitors offerings. My only complaint is that the hop flavor is hidden by the use of roasted barley. Nevertheless a great stout!",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,-1.0,0.0,-1.0

It has a mild golden color, but with a moderate maltiness and medium body suggesting the use of a low lovibond Munich malt in conjunction with a dextrinous ""Carapils"" malt to add body. I enjoy the malt characteristics, well done for a pale beer, but the hopping is much too subdued. True, Galena hops are a nice choice for bittering and Cascade are exceptional for flavoring and aroma, but what proportions are being used? The back label suggests ""heavy hopping"" and ""a particularly refreshing"" taste. I note very little hop flavor and equally as little aroma. The malt stands out more than anything else. This is not ""refreshing"" at all. The beer mirrors none of what I consider to be good IPA's. The Yakima region is known for it's plentiful hop production. My question is: Where are they? The label signifies class and tradition. I think this is a tradition worth ending. ""Two Thumbs Down!!!""",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-1.0

The aroma is a very refreshing fruity malt smell. I love this quality in beers. It tastes light with a med. addition of caramel malts. It is high in alcohol boasting 7.7% abv. , but is still very drinkable. A good beer to drink cold. I didn't detect much in the line of high powered hopping for either flavor or aroma. Overall, this is not a bad beer, but not the best that Cooperstown has to offer. It could do a little more with better head retention, higher hopping, and a larger aray of malt complexity, but how many beers do you know that could do the same.",4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,0.0,-1.0,,-1.0
