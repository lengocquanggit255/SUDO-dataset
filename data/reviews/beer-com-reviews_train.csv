49degrees,Arrogant Bastard Ale,92,2025-02-07 00:00:00,American Strong Ale,"An exceptional dark amber ale fully of character and a striking amount of hops. ""This is an aggressive"" beer says the label, and I'll vouch that it doesn't lie. I had this beer on tap several weeks back and really enjoyed it but found that it was surprinsingly close to Mac & Jacks African Amber Ale. Being able to sit back and relax with a bottle in hand and the time and place to actually take some better notes to review it, I'm guessing my notes were wrong, or I was poured the wrong beer. (As such, I've resubmitted my review for this beer). From the bottle, Arrogant Bastard doesn't look, smell or taste like Mac & Jacks, it's far superior. AB pours a deep reddish hue with a big white rocky head. Glass lacing is extensive. Aroma wise, this one carries a very enjoyable hoppy kick, hints of fruit, and complex malts. It doesn't carry the pine hit that the Ruination IPA offers, which helps to make this a much more rounded ale which can be savored in more than one serving per sitting. On the palette, the hops and malts are creatively balanced, providing hints of fruit, toasted malts and a slight peppery smokiness to it. Despite its edgy hoppiness, the malt factor kicks in to really make this an exceptionally well rounded ale that can be enjoyed again and again. Great balance worth a closer look for those who have yet to venture into the grip of the Arrogant Bastard. (ADDENDUM: 12/27/02 I had the opportunity to visit a place called Fogg & Suds on the outskirts of Vancouver, BC the other day, and to my astonishment this place is ""trying"" to fetch $30.00cdn for a bottle of this stuff.

It is made with wet hops on the first day of the Tasmanian hop harvest. I must say I was surprised by this beer as I was expecting nothing more than an Aussie lager style beer that had been made with ale yeast. It's not much more than that but it certainly is a drinkable beer. The flavour is somewhat like wet grass/hay but that is about the only remarkable flavour or aroma. I will most likely try next years batch ( 2004 ) but hopefully I won't have to pay it's undeserved price.,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.5,,1.0,,0.0

Keo was quite a drinkable beer. Nothing super special, but, I certainly wouldn't knock the offer of one back.

I highly recommned this one. The aroma is lacking unless served at about 50 degrees. The palate is very pleased with the overall texture and taste of this fine stout.,4.5,4.0,4.0,5.0,Fuller's ESB,219,2025-09-05 00:00:00,Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB),This is a great ESB. Hop Heads Unite!!! I love hops and this one just rings my bell. Fullers has some of the best Hop mixes in the world in my humble opinion The head is somewhat lacking in that it settles to quick for my taste. But that is it's only fault. The hops an dmalt blend so perfectly that they seem like one ingredient. A must drink for any serious beer drinker. But beware - this is a hoppy one. Not for the untrained palate.

Not as full or complete as Youngs, but a lot of taste that finishes well with just a touch or tartness.

Just the slightest of hoppy bitterness at the end, leaving you just tart enough to want to wet your pallet again with the wonderful brew. Everything seem just about perfect for the style.

The beer was however a golden, rich colour, rather nice. No lace either, which sorta hurt the appearance of the brew. Smell was weak, and was dominated by malt. A bit of floral hops peeked its way in, and I noticed whatsmelled to me like apples. A nice smell, but simply too weak. Flavour wasn't really there either. It comes about sweet and grainy at first, and then recedes to a sharp, oily hoppy bitterness, the best part of the beer in my opinion. Mouthfeel wasn't exceptional as carbonation was weak, while on the other hand it wasn't all that strong in body either. An okay beer. Might be nice on a sweltering day. Better than Heineken and the like, but nothing exceptional. I simply wonder why the establishment I had this at carries Harp when two decent microbreweries exist on the very same street, and both put out nicer lagers than this one.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
bearjohnson,Blanche De Chambly,31,5,Witbier,"Pours out a glimmering, hazy lemony cloud. When the light hits it, it looks like beams of sunshine in a glass. Very nice in that respect. Head is magnificent, pillowy, pure white, and made up of a legion of bubbles. Smell is spicy and soft simultaneously. Yeast and dried citrus. Pleasant, but a little weak. Taste is also both sweet and spicy. A bit of hops sits in the background, lending a bit of an oily chacter to the beer. Otherwise, it is dominated by a sharp, sulfuric flavour, some dried citrus peel. In some ways, the flavour is reminiscent of a dry white wine. However, this overall flavour is simply too watery. It's there, its simply none too robust. Mouthfeel is nice, to put it simply. Carbonation gets the tongue tingling, while the overall body is smooth. Understated flavour combined with this mouthfeel and a not too obscene alcohol content makes Blanche du Chambly a very drinkable ale. However, for taste, I prefer a Hoe. Au revoir!",4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,Brick Premium Lager,5906,5,American Pale Lager,"As far as Canadian lagers go, this is a pretty decent one. Not the most attractive brew on the planet, it sports a yellow-to-gold smock. Looks slightly tepid, but is topped with a reasonably thick, white head, which quickly exits stage. Smells like malt, and lots of it. A bit of hops lend a slight grassy, lemony scent. Smells alright, but nothing to write home about. Tastes better than it smells or looks. Not a ton of hops, but enough that the malts are nicely balanced. Malts come across as slightly bready, while hops lend an oily character to the flavour. Tastes a bit like apples towards the end. Nice, especially compared to other beers of this style. Mouth feel and drinkability are the strong suits here. Not watery in the mouth, it also lacks any real body -- I suppose what one would expect from a lager. Carbonation isnt off the hook; fairly moderate. Nice flavour, pleasant mouthfeel lend to immense drinkability. Pretty good as far as Canadian lagers go.

bearjohnson,Iron Duke,6238,2025-05-06 00:00:00,English Strong Ale,"A pretty beer. Pours in a sort of near ruby red to caramel brown. A ""vigorous"" pour results in a nice thick, bubbly, tan head. Though the head dissapears too quickly, it leaves a stubborn lace which clings to the glass, charting your progress. Smells of alcohol and prunes. Lots of malt too, overall quite a sweet smell. Tastes better than it smells. I made the mistake of pouring it too cold. As it warmed, the flavours came through. Alcohol still dominates a bit. The prunes in the smell come through in the flavour, as does alot of malty sweetness. I honestly cannot detect any real hops...the only bitterness present is coming from what I assume are lightly roasted malts, giving a coffeeish flavour on the back of the tongue. After swallowing, comes across as very clean. Low carbonation yields quite a smooth journey across my tongue. Too damn drinkable. At 6.5%, that means trouble.

The alcohol taste in this is very light, and there is almost no aftertaste. I would say most of this beer's qualities are due to the usage of rice, making it crisp and non-overpowering. My recommendation? Since I'm not an AB hater, I would recommend this with pizza, or hanging out with the guys. Just a normal beer when you don't want anything special.",2.5,2.0,2.0,2.5,Bud Light,1320,2025-02-04 00:00:00,Light Lager,"If you're a fan of beer, you're probably not watching your calorie intake anyway, so the only reason these types of beers exist is for people who really don't like the full taste of a real beer. Nevertheless, I'm reviewing Bud Lite (review #2 for me, if you're following my beer journey), which is up there in terms of popularity next to Coors Light (in NJ, anyway, which is Coors Light country). I don't automatically have a predetermined dislike for Anheuser-Busch, so I'm going into this review giving it a fair shake. First off, this stuff is paler than normal Bud. A VERY pale straw color. It forms a better head than Bud, but not by much. I took a sniff, and I don't know if I got a bad bunch but the smell was kind of like a musty grain smell. Not too good. I took a taste and luckily it tasted better than the smell. A very slight malt taste and absoultely no hop character. No bitterness here, folks. Very watery, and not as carbonated as regular Bud. The aftertaste is just about non-existant, as is the alcohol taste. Whereas Budweiser specifically lists that it is brewed with rice on it's label, Bud Light says ""select grains"", meaning there's probably corn AND rice in there (not to mention a slew of other Anheuser-Busch chemicals). I do find it very drinkable, as it would go great with greasy BBQ food. A non-offensive beer, and I am sure that there are worse beers than this out there.",2.5,1.5,2.0,2.5,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0

beerresearcher,Anchor Liberty Ale,665,6,American Pale Ale (APA),"Liberty American Style Pale Ale is, without a doubt, Anchor Brewing's best year round offering. The wonderful hop bouquet is immediately noticed and appreciated when poured into the glass and unlike most American pale ales, the aroma lingers, albeit more subtlety as the brew disappears. The rich copper color shines brightly. I believe Maaco should offer this color in a car paint. They could call it 'Liberty Deep Copper'. It would certainly look great on my Jeep! After taking the time to fully admire the fine hop nose and rich copper color, the next outstanding trait of Liberty Pale Ale one notices is the hop distinctive taste. The fresh whole hops are in abundance, yet not overwhelming. There's a crisp metallic sharp-edged bitterness with light citrus undertones. The sharpness diminishes slightly as you drink it down and the hop to malt difference becomes less exaggerated and more balanced and smooth. The medium to full malt body is lightly sweet with a hint of nuts. It seems to me that a lot of care has been taken in the malt roasting process. My hats off to the Brew Master.

Also available in bottles but draft is outstanding. Strong but not overdone.,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.5,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,731,2025-04-05 00:00:00,Hefeweizen,"This is one of my favorite hefe's. They have been brewing beer for almost 1000 years so you can always count on getting a good quality beer. Many of the Hefe=weiss around the world get their yeast from Weihenstephen. I prefer the draft versions over bottles as it seems to have more of the phenolic (bananna) charecter that I like in a hefe. Golden color. Cloudy, rich creamy head that you can float a quarter on...",4.5,4.5,5.0,5.0,,,,

blkknight02,Delirium Nocturnum,1421,2025-05-08 00:00:00,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,Wow! What a great beer! Pours a dark garnet/ruby... almost black. Strong head retention. Aromas of candied plums and a faint wisp of raisins - not like that of Special B though. Must be from the yeast. Very little hop aroma (as it should be) but enough flavor to cut the sweetness of the malt and sugar. High octane brew at 9% but easily drinkable. Seek this one out!,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,Two Hearted Ale,1093,7,American IPA,"My first chance to sample this highly rated brew since Bell's has just begun to be distributed in our area. The beer poured a light copper to dark amber hue with an adequate amount of head. The lacework stayed on the glass the entire pint. Aroma of piney/citrusy hops (chinook and cascades?) with a hint of sweetness in the background. Somewhat fruity as well. Hops overwhelm the malt but there is a finish of sweetness followed by a lingering bitterness. Very biting mouthfeel due top the carbonation level and the IBU's involved.

The hop flavor is a bit harsh and lingering - maybe chinook or galena? The malt profile is very nice/complex. Not overly sweet or cloying.

Beer poured an amber color with a thin head kept alive by a constant stream of bubbles. Nice fruity, malty smell with a hint of hops. Taste was very pleasing - good malts and some caramel to start, understated hops in the dry finish, and well hidden alcohol content. The mix was a fine balance. I was pleasantly surprised at how smooth it was. I went back for a second and began to wonder why I was getting a bit wobbly near the end when I noted the ABV.

When poured properly, leaving a little in the bottle and swirling to decant all the sediment,Blue Moon has a very nice cloudyness. Gold with a slightly orangy hue,it hold a modest head as it goes down. The aroma is filled with belgian character and spices.Coriander,orange,citrus,lemony tartness.Fairly straightforward as far as the belgian character goes,nothing too funky.No hops are apparent. The mouthfeel is decent with good carbonation and thin to medium body. Lots of flavors to take in, and the tartness from the wheat and assorted spices keep you returning for another sip. Citrus notes,some pepperiness,and friuty esters. Not a whole lot of complexity though. This beer grows on you and I have come to enjoy it from time to time,and it's available just about anywhere, at a reasonable price. One of the very few ""micro style"" beers that have been sucessfully brewed and sold by the big guys. Blue moon is really good with Mussels steamed in it with garlic and butter.A bag of chips on the side and maybe some pickeled hop shoots.",4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0

brewandbbq,Baltus O.V.S. Ale,3528,8.2,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,"I'm happy to find more and more micros not necessarily brewing to style as of late.This tasty offering from Heavyweight is a great example. It has a very nice dark ruby color and pours with a decent head that quickly diminishes,and a slight haze at cellar temperature. The nose promises many delights for the palate. Reminicent of many a holiday or winter brew,the aroma is sweet and fruity.Nice malt in the background,with warming alcohol and spicyness. Also some notes of vanilla,cherries,sugar and maybe spearmint? Esters,spice and alcohol-reminds me of a belgian,but cleaner. The mouthfeel is fullish and a little syrupy,a little low on the carbonation.This is a beer that could benefit from nice lacework and fine bubbles pushing all its complexities up you nostrils. The flavor is sweet as expected with lots of malt ,some spiceyness that lingers, and alcohols that warms. The rich character is balanced nicely by some hop bitterness taking a back seat to all else. This beer would do well to be cellared for 1-2 years, or would be great on cask,or best aged in some oak.. It would be exeptional with smoked sausages and a variety of pungent mustards-Maybe a hop shoot salad on the side with shaved Reggiano and portabello bits sauteed in O.V.S.! Hats off to Heaveyweight!

Drank one while I grilled, had the other with my food. Nice golden color, white bubbly head that weaves a tapestry of lacework down the glass as you drink it. I wanted to pour an oversized head to see how it retained, I still had a residue amount towards the bottom. It did have a skunky element to it, but it wasn't overpowering. I would like to get a few of these the day they arrive at the store and see if a fresher beer has less skunk to it. That damn green glass, huh? Anyway, the taste was flavorfully rich, full malt character with a very pleasant bitter finish which easily outweighed the skunky factor. Even at this stage of the beer's life I could probably drink this all night. The 2nd beer made me think I should start doing this with all beer, have one with food and one without, because it went with a hot mett just perfect. The moderate carbonation is more prevalent, but the malt still cuts through, an interesting experiment.

Massive bubbles on the pour, which I forgot about at first, creating a bubble overage. Impressive aroma, but something happened on the taste part. I know Michael Jackson loves this beer, but I must be too inexperienced to appreciate it. It wasn't until I was halfway through the half glass I had for the taste testing when it hit me - Robitussin. Robitussin and, and...olives? Yeah, olives and Robitussin. The initial sensation in the mouth is different, but it always ended up Robitussin.

Not a slam on Bud or Miller, but with the Hoegaarden she had a breakthrough. Maybe it's because this beer is unfiltered and closer to 'raw' beer, I thought she'd wince or make a face and proclaim how awful it tasted. Happily, I was surprised when her face lit up at the first taste. This really is an ideal Belgian to start out with, if you're new to this area. A creamy, smooth head, an unintimidating and inviting aroma. A wonderful slightly lemony sourish flavor, but not anywhere near pucker-invoking. There's just enough sweetness to balance it out. How do they *do* that?!?! This beer feels so good in the mouth, so smooth, you could salt away 4 or 5 with little effort. We rarely have a tasting where we will drink 2 of the same thing, but I swear if I'd had a 2nd bottle of this, we would have done just that. She made a statement about Genessee Cream Ale, but it's been ages since I had that beer. Genessee may compare in mouthfeel and overall zero likelihood of having any offensive components, but I don't think it could reach Hoegaarden's taste at all. As Marty Brennaman says when a baseball player swings at a pitch waaaay out of the strike zone, 'He couldn't havef hit that with an ironing board'. That's Genessee's chance of out-flavoring this ale. If you haven't had one, have one. If you've had one, have two. :-)",4.0,4.0,5.0,4.5,0.0,1.0,,-1.0

canadianbarman,Hobgoblin,236,2025-02-05 00:00:00,English Brown Ale,"**My 4th review** This beer was so cool looking on the shelf that I just had to give it a try. I opted for drinking staight out of the bottle for no reason other than the bottle (and label) are interesting. --My only complaint was that it seemed a bit skunky.

cbl2,Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout,782,7,Russian Imperial Stout,"Perhaps my favorite beer of all time, Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout pours from the bottle almost pitch black with a nice quarter inch head that rapidly settles and laces the side of the glass.

All the longing, striving, seeking, waiting, yearning... The folks at Sean Bolan's Pub in Federal Hill, Baltimore, MD purchased a wooden pin (5.4 gallon cask) of this elixir in 2002.

In appearance, J. W. was burnished brown and copper, the age in wood having contributed several degrees of shade to that of the bottled version. No sparkler was used so the beer tumbled nearly headless from the wood. The carbonation was mere points over nil, but that seemed appropriate for quiet sipping and contemplation. The aroma, in order of appearance: a quick whiff of pencil graphite, then waves of dark rum, raisins, dried plums, peat, sea air, Scotch whisky, vanilla, shortbread biscuits, malted milk candy, and the pungent aroma of a roaring fireplace. The body was all soft shoulders and dangerous curves, the aromas reappearing as flavors in teasing combinations, different with each sip. Smokiness of the Lagavulin-soaked wood lounged blissfully in the finish, a counterweight to J.W.'s voluptuous maltiness and potency. Sean Bolan's served the ale at a temperature of 55 or so degrees. One's afterglow was several degrees more ardent. 'Tis the answer, 'tis the end and all... Early in the evening, a gentlemen walked into Sean Bolan's looking for a mainstream 'lite' beer.

cizauskas,Ale Mary,2248,6,Winter Warmer,"RCH is a fascinating little brewery in Cheddar country north of Dorset, England. (The initials stand for the name of the hotel in which the proprietors began the brewery before outgrowing the digs.) Their cask ales are consistently well-made and stellar even on this side of the pond. The fun begins with the label, where an inscription wraps above the portrait of Mary, Queen of Scots: ""a well-executed bottle-conditioned ale"". At 6% alcohol, this is stronger than the average bitter from the UK. It was awarded Bottle-Conditioned Beer of the year at the 2001 GBBF. Pour the beer into a LARGE glass and allow a minute or so of anticipation for the great mass of goo-goo eyed bubbles to escape and form a prodigious spumous head. Then...what an aroma! It's like the smell of a fresh-from-the-oven fruitcake wafting in from the NEXT room with a vase of long-stem roses nearby. That is, it's there but not cloying. The brewery says Ale Mary was infused with ginger, cloves, cinnamon, coriander, nutmeg, and pimento(!). The exclamation point (for that last ingredient) is mine. The flavor and finish return to the Bitter verities: a shortbread maltiness and a bracing bitterness. For all the spices used, the beer is quaffable and well-balanced.",3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,J.W.

Here was a worthy successor to the late lamented Eldridge Pope Brewery's Thomas Hardy barley wine: a lusty 11.5% alcohol level yet still a beer, nearly still but with a whisper of spritzig, revealing itself with peel after peel of complexity. In appearance, J. W. was burnished brown and copper, the age in wood having contributed several degrees of shade to that of the bottled version. No sparkler was used so the beer tumbled nearly headless from the wood. The carbonation was mere points over nil, but that seemed appropriate for quiet sipping and contemplation. The aroma, in order of appearance: a quick whiff of pencil graphite, then waves of dark rum, raisins, dried plums, peat, sea air, Scotch whisky, vanilla, shortbread biscuits, malted milk candy, and the pungent aroma of a roaring fireplace. The body was all soft shoulders and dangerous curves, the aromas reappearing as flavors in teasing combinations, different with each sip. Smokiness of the Lagavulin-soaked wood lounged blissfully in the finish, a counterweight to J.W.'s voluptuous maltiness and potency. Sean Bolan's served the ale at a temperature of 55 or so degrees.

I happen to really enjoy sour beers, so I was not disappointed - but if you have this vintage and don't don't want it totally sour you may want to drink up soon. The 1996 vintage is probably not a good example of the Old Ale style (as tasted in 2003), which is why the score is a bit low, even though drinking this beer was very enjoyable.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,,0.0

darkale,Allgäuer Cambonator Doppelbock,2863,2025-02-07 00:00:00,Doppelbock,"Decided to depart from my ""east coast of the United States"" mindset, and pulled this beer out of the specialty cooler at my favorite beer store. Started out the afternoon -- a nasty mix of sleet and snow is pelting the windows, so a beer tasting session seemed like a good idea -- with a 2002 SN Celebration Ale (not too many left in Feb of '03), and then moved on to this Cambonator. As far as the appearance of the label is concerned, I cannot improve upon the only other review of this beer that mentioned the label, save to say that it depicts the sort of scene that would make one want to have a dopplebock, which would seem to be the point. Sweet malt smell very evident after opening. Short, dense, off-white head that settled down to a thin rim of white in a few minutes. Very small pearly bubbles in the head. Color is quite dark, hardly translucent; putting a bright light behind my glass shows a beatiful deep cherry color. Round and sweet taste improves with slight warming. Slight bitterness at the tip of the tongue. Toasty, and again, very sweet! Mouthfeel is slick, leaves a slight, pleasant aftertaste at mid-tongue, almost fruity. Not as brutish as an Optimator; more subtle and thin (with no offense intended).",4.0,4.5,4.5,4.0,Troegenator Double Bock,4109,2025-02-08 00:00:00,Doppelbock,"An interesting beer. I like double bocks, but this does not taste like most of the double bocks that I have enjoyed in the past; yet, I cannot find it in me to condemn this beer. The cap came off with little noise, and indeed it is difficult to create much of a head with this beer. I've had three in the past couple of days, and resorted to pouring the last straight up into my glass; that way, I got a head of about an inch and a half, which quickly settled into a tan skim with a little bit of lace. Very little aroma. The taste is a very smoky, maple syrup, with a slice of ginger snap in the middle. There is also an odd thin afterburn of alcohol and charcoal. I have actually come to like that after-taste, though it was not pleasant at first. The taste that lingers is alcohol and charcoal. That does not sound appealing, but it is not as bad as one might think. In reading some of the other reviews for this beer I see references to malt whisky, and I wish I had thought of that at first -- that is exactly it, it is like Scotch, really. This is an intriguing beer. You take a sip, put it down, and think about it for a while. Worth trying. NOTE FROM OCTOBER, 2003.

darkale,Brooklyn Ale / Pennant Ale '55,836,5,English Pale Ale,"I wanted to love this beer, because Brooklyn Brown is one of my house favorites; however, I just cannot love it. The bottle design is classic, and I love the deep dark and simple blue of the label against the brown glass. The bottle says classic, but the beer does not follow through. The aroma at first is very sweet, and that was a surprise. It pours out a dense but not full head, which dissipates within a gulp or two. Personally, I like the head to stick around for a while, but no amount of swirling would bring much of it back. A personal taste, and not necessarily a mark against a beer. The taste is sweet; that taste, combined with the smell as the nose goes into the glass, made me have a quick thought of the Octoberfest style. Right after the sweetness is a mid-tongue burst of hops, which lingers. The hops taste to me is like an old-fashioned ginger ale; that's the taste that remains in my mouth. Despite the hops snap, it's a thin beer, to me. And there is an aftertaste that I cannot define. It comes after that ginger. I don't like it, but I am hard-pressed to describe it. It's fruity, but I can't get much closer than that.",4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,Troegenator Double Bock,4109,2025-02-08 00:00:00,Doppelbock,"An interesting beer.

Typical 500 ml bottle, with a simple green and gold label. Sweet aroma upon opening, with a slight whiff of cinnamon. Thick head is more cream than white, subsides to about a half-inch soon after pouring. Beer is a cloudy caramel-orange color. Nice hop bite in the middle of a lot of sweetness. Citrus flavors. This is a bright, cheery beer, one of my favorite marzens. In my notes I wrote, ""This is a damned lovely beer"" after my first sip, and nothing I tasted all the way down to the very last bit of foam made me wish to change my opinion.

By which I mean, I am able to appreciate its complexity, but it's not a beer that I would ever wish to have again. Beautiful label, very well designed; I bought the 12 oz. version, and it emitted a loud and powerful ""snap"" when I opened it; as expected, it erupted into a fabulous, large-bubbled tan head. Immediate fruity aroma, with the most evocative banana scent that I have ever encountered in a beer. I was surprised, though, that there was no hint of bananas when I pushed past the head and drank the actual beer. Instead, I found a broad wash of hops across my tongue, a powerful, smoky push up against my palate, and a crisp, grainy mouthfeel, as if a couple of ounces of black pepper had been turned into beer. Over an hour later, I can still taste it in my mouth. But, I do not revel in the lingering taste. I wish sincerely that I loved this beer, but when I drank it, I felt like a tone-deaf person at the symphony. I want to dance with my beer, not fight with it. It's the beer version of a broad-shouldered red zinfandel wine, or one of those filling-rattling cabernet sauvignons. My senses were definitely engaged, but they did not like it.

I like double bocks, but this does not taste like most of the double bocks that I have enjoyed in the past; yet, I cannot find it in me to condemn this beer. The cap came off with little noise, and indeed it is difficult to create much of a head with this beer. I've had three in the past couple of days, and resorted to pouring the last straight up into my glass; that way, I got a head of about an inch and a half, which quickly settled into a tan skim with a little bit of lace. Very little aroma. The taste is a very smoky, maple syrup, with a slice of ginger snap in the middle. There is also an odd thin afterburn of alcohol and charcoal. I have actually come to like that after-taste, though it was not pleasant at first. The taste that lingers is alcohol and charcoal. That does not sound appealing, but it is not as bad as one might think. In reading some of the other reviews for this beer I see references to malt whisky, and I wish I had thought of that at first -- that is exactly it, it is like Scotch, really. This is an intriguing beer. You take a sip, put it down, and think about it for a while. Worth trying. NOTE FROM OCTOBER, 2003.

Sweet malt smell very evident after opening. Short, dense, off-white head that settled down to a thin rim of white in a few minutes. Very small pearly bubbles in the head.

I was surprised, though, that there was no hint of bananas when I pushed past the head and drank the actual beer. Instead, I found a broad wash of hops across my tongue, a powerful, smoky push up against my palate, and a crisp, grainy mouthfeel, as if a couple of ounces of black pepper had been turned into beer.

Smell: Hops, pine &#8211; not very strong, but the aroma may have been masked by the cigarette smoke in the bar. (I would like to smell the aroma of this beer without any other distracting odors). Taste: Wow! Very strong hoppy and pine flavor when it first hits the mouth. But this beer also has some body to it. There is another taste that kicks in right after the hops taste but I do not know what it is. The best word I can use to describe it is &#8220;deep&#8221;, and this flavor remained as the aftertaste.

Drinkability: The alcohol in this beer hit me very quickly &#8211; more quickly than other beers I&#8217;ve had with the same or greater ABV (perhaps it&#8217;s the ingredients that cause the alcohol to be absorbed more quickly).

Smell: Hints of chocolate and coffee. Taste: I was suprised by the initial hops flavor. That flavor is followed by a sweet, almost raisin-like taste, and then finishes with a nutty taste. I liked the three-phase taste - very good. Mouthfeel: Slightly dry. Drinkability: Slight alcohol taste, but drinks very easy.

The mouthfeel was suprisingly good, lots of carbonation, light and crisp and when swallowed left my mouth a little dry. The drinkability is pretty good due to the fact it is a light and refreshing beer and on a hot summer day or after a hard day at work I wouldn't mind. But when I go to a pub I go for beer I can thoroughly anjoy and marvel at it's taste. So I apologize for not having all that much to say, I guess I was just very un-impressed.

First off you get the awesome cascading effect of the nitro can and when poured right it will settle a nice pitch black with a small thick head.

The head retention is amazing and it almost looks like icrecream atop a rootbeer float. The head laces the glass nicely and the mouthfeel is creamy and delicious. This beer is pretty damn good and if your'e looking for an irish stout via the store I would skip the guinness draught cans and grab this instead. very drinkable.

Pours syrupy with no head, especially if one follows the directions on the bottle indicating to pour slowly, and I am a sucker for directions on the bottle. Color is incredibly dark brown, completely opaque. Leaves a slight lace as one slowly sips this beer down. Smell is quite complex and sorting it out completely is above the ability of my paltry nose. I would describe it as a sweet and slightly fruity (think figs, raisins). The enigmatic smell seems to call out drink me, and so I listen. Overtones of alcohol do not seem to affect the complex flavor, even though you do feel your BA levels rising as you sip this bad boy down. It seems the smell did not lie, as the taste of the beer is itself sweet and slightly fruity (again I'm thinking of figs and raisins), but there seems to be even more to sort out. There is a bitterness which comes initially and seems to be countered immediately by the sweet flavor described earlier.

Good deal for what i pay (a short trip down the NYS Thruway from the brewery) - about $5.99 a 6-pack. The beer has a fresh aroma with a slight hint of banana. It pours well to about an inch head which unfortuneately dissipates too quickly for my liking. The taste is a typical and very good interpretation of the hefe-weizen taste, very refreshing and crisp.

Head retention was poor. Color was a wonderful golden hue, held in the light is glowed. But this beer was mostly show. The glassware making look like it might be the best beer I'd ever had. Very yeasty, with the usual hints of Belgium spice thrown in there but nothing too overwhelming, clove, correander, the usual. Slight hops but just at the finish, nothing major.

emobeerguy,Storm King Stout,1013,2025-01-09 00:00:00,Russian Imperial Stout,"Okay, here goes my first review! Had this brew on tap at Monk's in Philly. Being a local they serve this on tap for 2.50, a pitance when compared to the Belgium stuff they've got. And let me tell you, although its a completely different brew than say the Chimay White (I prefered SKS) I had just prior, this beer deserves to be poured with some of the best. Great head and head retention for a stout. Sharp hoppy nose, like we have come to exspect from storm king. Apperance, black as a moonless night. I described the taste to another patron as imagining the deepest chocolate stout you've ever had and then adding a punchy hop finish to that. He tried one immediately, and I must say that, though my friend had been at Monk's for a few hours by that time, he was immediately impressed. I like this one better on tap than from the bottle though its a beer to get whenever you see it. The pinnacle of the Victory collection and a tribute to American Brewing.",5.0,5.0,4.5,5.0,Grog,4199,5.25,English Brown Ale,"When I had this on tap at Nodding Head this weekend, the blackboard at-top the bar said this was a brown ale (hope to clear up some confusion). Poored with little head, but I was not exspecting much of one. Malty nose. Tasted like an embellished Newcastle, strong malts with a nutty, semi-sweet finish. Very smooth brew. A flavorful, yet easy drinking beer. Much better than the other Nodding Head fair that I sipped (my friends pints). Probably the beer to get if you can only try one down a Nodding Head.

emobeerguy,Chimay Tripel (White),1346,8,Tripel,"Had this on tap at Monk's who, as you probably already know, where the first to get this on tap outside of Belgium. I am not well versed in the Tripel style, but I have had all of the Chimay's and found this one to be the most bland. My first thought was that it tasted much like a less hoppy, even less yeasty all in all more mellowed and less flavorful version of Ommegang's Hennepin (though Hennepin claims a different style). Head retention was poor. Color was a wonderful golden hue, held in the light is glowed. But this beer was mostly show. The glassware making look like it might be the best beer I'd ever had. Very yeasty, with the usual hints of Belgium spice thrown in there but nothing too overwhelming, clove, correander, the usual. Slight hops but just at the finish, nothing major. A very solid brew, but for my money, I would skip it and buy some Hennepin. Not worth the import price.",4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,Heart Of Darkness,297,2025-03-05 00:00:00,Oatmeal Stout,"Had this bottled. Pours to a very dark black. No light coming through this beer. Small, stoutish head, even after a vigorous pouring, though it suited the beer just fine. Taste is dominated by smoke and chocolate malts. A very smooth finish, not too heavy. Though it is new and seasonal, if it were around longer/more often, I think this could become a benchmark for American Stouts. Not terribly complex but well handled and very smooth, hearty. As close as I reckon a good stout could get to being sessionable. My favorite Magic Hat to date, though I hear good thinks about Blind Faith.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,,,-1.0

The label boasts of complex hoppiness and intense flavor. Just a primer for what is to come! Mad Hatter pours nicely, with a gorgeous light-amber body and plenty of fizz. The head is decent, lasting longer than some other pale ales, notably Sierra Nevada. The nose smacks of lovely hops. OH! The hops! This is the beer for hops lovers, for sure. The scent is intriguing and very extraordinary, with sweetness and scents of pear, apple, and even citrus! The taste of Mad Hatter can be best described as having a strong punch of hops at the beginning, followed by the more mellow pear, apple and citrus notes, with even.... a little grassiness i think? Even, for a moment... a slight amount of maltiness is apparent. Mad Hatter finishes dry, with almost no alcohol taste and a smooth bitterness which leaves me longing for another! The mouthfeel is nearly perfect, with plenty silkiness in the body and just the right amount of carbonation for this style. Very nice finish. I would say this beer is definitely a ""session"" beer, but I am partial to mixing and matching in my beer drinking sessions.

It pours a deep orange brown, with a small head whose tiny bubbles retreat into a thin foamy layer of top and lace. The smell comes off first as very fruity, with a distinct hint of mango. After succesive sniffs, a smooth malt, masked by metallic and bitter hoppiness comes out. You can feel this beer in the back of your head when you smell it. The taste carries over some elements from the smell, with the same metallic bitterness giving a bite at first, while citrusy notes cover the malt in the background. The whole taste evens out into a bitter, burnt-pine taste, almost like a pine cone smells in a fire. All in all, a very good beer, one which I would drink again any day.",4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,-1.0,,1.0
franklinpcombs,Summer Ale,287,2025-01-05 00:00:00,American Pale Ale (APA),"This is a great ale for a hot summer afternoon. The color is a light orangish yellow, and quite clear. The head consists of large white bubbles which rapidly dissipate into nothing more than a thin ring of lace. Smell is minimal, with barely noticable hints of hops and malt. Drinken cold, this beer has a very good, smooth mouthfeel, with a pleasant amount of carbonation gracing the tongue. Taste was nothing special, just mild malt flavor with subtle undertones of hops which stick around for a mild aftertaste.

hardtarget,Samuel Smith's Winter Welcome Ale,577,6,Winter Warmer,"2002-3 550 ML Bottle. Aroma: A malty sweetness topped with a hint of orange. Appearance: A sunny tangerine with a frothy head of small bubbles that linger a while, but fade into a light lace. Flavor: OMG that's good! Very well balanced with a slight edge to a malt sweetness. Has a wonderful lemon/citrus finish and aftertaste. I was shocked to find this in the Barley Wine category, think Strong Ale may be more precise, but still misleading. Those beers invoke the idea of a meal in a bottle. This is more of an appetizer. Mouthfeel: Full, rich, round, beautiful. Thin for a Barley Wine, but again, not your average Barley Wine. Overall: Drinkability? Like a book you can't put down. Had no trouble at all with the 550 ML's and could drink two more and be a happy man. Expected a heavier beer for a winter welcome, but this warms the belly and cheers the tongue. I know what I'm going to ask Santa for! Re-reviewed about a year later. Well, I asked Santa for some, but I was disappointed in the gift. I don't know if this years batch changed, or I got a particularly aged bottle for my first review.

Some cider notes in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel: A light viscosity that is rounded by slight oat stickiness. Heavy carbonation that I feel is a touch overdone. Overall: An unusual beer. The bottle describes it as a beer for March, between Winter and Spring. They seem to have wanted to blend a winter celebration beer with a lighter, fruitier Spring beer.

Well, I asked Santa for some, but I was disappointed in the gift. I don't know if this years batch changed, or I got a particularly aged bottle for my first review. This beer is much harsher, none of the fruity malt tastes I got last time. Looks like the category changed from barleywine (good). All in all, a decent beer, but just didn't re-blow my socks off.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,-1.0
hardtarget,Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock,131,2025-07-06 00:00:00,Doppelbock,"Aroma: Deep dark malt, no noticeable hops. Appearance: Black, with flashes of blood red in front of a serious light source. My bottle seemed a little flat, very light head that evaporated almost instantly, with no lacing. Maybe it was just my bottle. Flavor: Fairly straightforward dark malt, with a hint of a maple syrup (blackstrap?). The first taste is the same as the aftertaste: very good both ways. Mild alcohol warming, but not intense. Mouthfeel: I found it a little light given the rich taste, I expect to have to chew, but it's very smooth. Overall: Man this went down quick.

The balance is definitely on the hops side. I experienced some buttery esters as well. Mouthfeel: Touch heavy on the carbonation and not the warmth I got from other Barley Wines. The hops are so strong that I got a bit of astringency as well. Overall impression: I know this ranks high in the overall for the site but I found this to be enjoyable, but not quite a celebration.

As soon as my nose crossed the rim of the glass, the aroma impaled my head with its pungent decadence, and lodged there like some mind-controlling parasite from another star system, where it's planet's native atmosphere is a boiling cauldron of scrumptiously malty gaseous organic compounds. I had to give a 5 for smell because I could not see, with my limited insight, room for improvement. This heady rush reminded me of Old Wooly Barleywine from Big Time Brewery in Seattle (Excellent beer check it out limited distribution and availability). This beer is all about the malts up front. The thick, sweet flavors coat your mouth. I gave a 4 in mouthfeel because I can see this beer gaining another dimension with some nitro creaminess to balance the malts. Only after you have accepted the Double Bastard into your mouth do the hops make their presence known, which I feel is generally in a supporting role, though they successfully add to the complexity of this beer's sequence. Paying close attention reveals that the flavor profile is very well preserved. The aftertaste is a masterpiece, you can just sit there and continue tasting your last mouthful for several minutes. Like the best foods, this beer stays in your mouth long after its physical substance has passed to your nether-regions. All the while the aroma smolders in your nostrils with a potency that makes you wonder if your lungs are receiving enough oxygen to maintain vital metabolic processes. I had a Chimay Trippel (tap) immediately after this beer, and it's subtlety was dashed against the lingering presence of the Bastard. Have to remember next time to drink a palate cleanser before dropping 12 bucks on a Trappist ale. It was like coming back to your nice girlfriend after a tawdry encounter with an experienced older woman, and you don't feel guilty that you're bored with your girlfriend because it was worth every second. A landmark addition to strong american ales. IPAlot ps I had this bar at Mahar's in Albany (check the beerfly review this place is unreal). They had a raffle going for a *magnum* of 5th anniversary Arrogant Bastard. The bottle had a cork (obviously) and a big 5 on it, but I didn't look close, I just bought a ticket and offered praise, worship, and eternal servitude to any god who would bless me with a winning ticket.",4.5,5.0,4.0,4.5,,,0.0,-1.0

I usually pour a couple mouthfuls at a time from a liberal height to set the head off nice, and this beer holds it nice, and the gas in the beer makes it nice and creamy. An excellent blend of texture, assertiveness, and flavor....gotta do these guys the justice of buying a belgian glass.....",3.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,Double Bag,273,2025-02-07 00:00:00,Altbier,"I should state that I have seen this beer in a variety of states and degrees of quality, and have memories of an extremely flavorful beer which I surely would have scored better. App: beautful ruby orange, very transparent. Thin head. Smell: Low gas, scarce lace, aroma surely disappointing for a strong ale. Taste: Some caramel, chocolate, prunes, raisins, a bit of coffee. They had some heavily roasted stuff in here, but not a lot. Weak relative to what I expected. Mouthfeel: A pleasant creaminess makes this above average, but lacks the malty fullness I like in styles with these aspirations. Drinkability: The alcohol sneaks up on you since this beer is quite smooth and drinkable.

ipalot,Double Bastard Ale,1056,2025-05-10 00:00:00,American Strong Ale,"I really felt quite violated after tasting this beer. As soon as my nose crossed the rim of the glass, the aroma impaled my head with its pungent decadence, and lodged there like some mind-controlling parasite from another star system, where it's planet's native atmosphere is a boiling cauldron of scrumptiously malty gaseous organic compounds. I had to give a 5 for smell because I could not see, with my limited insight, room for improvement. This heady rush reminded me of Old Wooly Barleywine from Big Time Brewery in Seattle (Excellent beer check it out limited distribution and availability). This beer is all about the malts up front. The thick, sweet flavors coat your mouth. I gave a 4 in mouthfeel because I can see this beer gaining another dimension with some nitro creaminess to balance the malts. Only after you have accepted the Double Bastard into your mouth do the hops make their presence known, which I feel is generally in a supporting role, though they successfully add to the complexity of this beer's sequence. Paying close attention reveals that the flavor profile is very well preserved. The aftertaste is a masterpiece, you can just sit there and continue tasting your last mouthful for several minutes. Like the best foods, this beer stays in your mouth long after its physical substance has passed to your nether-regions. All the while the aroma smolders in your nostrils with a potency that makes you wonder if your lungs are receiving enough oxygen to maintain vital metabolic processes. I had a Chimay Trippel (tap) immediately after this beer, and it's subtlety was dashed against the lingering presence of the Bastard. Have to remember next time to drink a palate cleanser before dropping 12 bucks on a Trappist ale. It was like coming back to your nice girlfriend after a tawdry encounter with an experienced older woman, and you don't feel guilty that you're bored with your girlfriend because it was worth every second.

The head fell apart within 2 minutes, collapsing in on itself and changing in color from brownish-orange to a light tan as it went. The taste was very mellow, certainly nothing spectacular, though. Mouthfeel was nothing to shake a stick at - no excitement, no breadth or depth. Easy to drink, and would make a lighter alternative to what my friends occasionally call ""Guinness night"".

It must have been one of those silly marketing focus groups. Oh well. In the glass the beer is a light copper with a two finger off-white head that dissipates quickly. The caramel maltiness of the past seems more restrained than what I recall. Crisp hops are nicely balanced with the malt....but again, much less assertive than I remember with this beer. It once had a signature hops bite that I really enjoyed, now just a shadow of its former self.

jon,90 Minute IPA,2093,9,American Double / Imperial IPA,"2003 bottling, aged five months. Slightly hazed peach color with a rocky white head that retains very well, leaving behind mazes of lace. Small traces of active carbonation are evident. Perfumy hops, overripe grapefruit, faint smokiness, caramel malt, trace alcohol and additional high alpha hop oils presist aromatically. Taste is far more balanced than fresh samples, though the initial, harsh hop bitterness is restrained. This results in a rounder, maltier 90 Minute with emphasis on ripe citrus fruit, caramel malt, residual malt sugars, a hint of smoke, and a lingering, yet restrained (for 90 Minute) hop bitterness. Fresh bottles reveal less balance and more hops, yet aging this bottle has led to a fuller, more balanced maltiness. Ample hop character still exists to fulfill any lupulinic yearning, which is the beauty of this particular bottle. Smooth mouthfeel, lightly carbonated and slightly oily. Drinks better than the fresh stuff -- smoother, more balanced and less of an alcoholic impact. A fun experiment with successful results.

I was really surprised with the head retention of this ale after letting it age for 3 years. Smell: Very complex with flavors. Honey, raisins, and many fruity flavors can be found. Taste: An awesome taste. There are so many flavors it is impossible to describe without one trying it for themselves. There are hints of honey, raisins and caramel. I enjoyed mine with some chocolate. The sweetness of the chocolate combined with the flavors of the ale made it taste that much more amazing. Mouthfeel: Smooth going down from beginning to end. It has a hint of the brandy warmth going down as well. Drinkability: This is an ale to be savored on special occasions and when you have some extra cash due to the price per bottle.

Poured this one and saw only a little lacy head on one side the glass, virtually none at all. A thick amber colored beer, looked almost like a jar of mountain honey in my frosty mug.

There is not much of a head so drinking can begin immediately, or at least no drinking through bubbles. Newcastle has a nice aroma. Not sweet but you can smell the malt. As much as I like Newcastle, I will admit that it can be skinky. Actually, I have never tasted a beer whose flavor varies from 6-pack to 6-pack as much as Newcastle. I don't know if it's the clear bottles or it may be old beer but it irritates me. However, I have had much more good than bad.

Hanging above the glass was a distinct malt with a hint of grain. A very tasty brew. I was struck that the taste was weak at the front-end but quite apparent after. I observed a bitter/hoppy taste, definite malt, and slight (almost imperceptible) sweetness. There was a slight carbonation but not at all fizzy. I enjoyed drinking this beer which would be a great one for meals, in my opinion. Overall, it could be my favorite British beer.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,0.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0

It may sound odd but since I visited England in the early 80's and since I learned that my ancestors are from Yorkshire, I really feel an affinity for most things Yorkshire. And so I continued my quest for knowledge. The Taddy Porter poured a DARK brown, nearly black. No light will penetrate this beer! The head was moderately frothy and only slightly dissipated in the couple of minutes I waited to taste. The aroma was relatively mild. I could smell the malt, which was a good sign. I was intrigued, which is exactly what I look for when I smell my beer. Sometimes, I wonder if the sight of a beer in glass creates a bias when I taste. I am not aware of one but I thought Id taste this beer with my eyes closed. Sure, Id seen the beer already but hey, I never pass up an opportunity to make a fool of myself. Upon first taste of the dark liquid, (I assumed it was dark, I had my eyes closed) I noticed a pronounced sweet molasses/malt flavor. The beer was slightly dry with very good carbonation. This helps the drinkability for me as it tickles the tongue. Hey...I love the tongue tickling! The beer did not weigh heavy, which surprised me, but I was looking for a more overt taste of alcohol. Thats not a criticism, really, because the flavor was good. Overall, this is a very good porter.

The label itself was kind of plain, featuring most just words and a drawing of a kind of noble-looking fellow. Around the drawing was German wording, which I believe translates to Julius Echter, First Bishop 1545-1617, founder of the university at Wurzburg. So apparently this brew is supposed to honor him. The head produced by the pour was very dense and rocky, really nice. The beer was amber in color with some orange overtones. The aroma features some hints of banana and clove springing out of a nice malty base. Flavor-wise, the beer was mostly sweet, but with a slight tartness, laced with some spiciness and some caramel notes. Hop notes are relegated to offsetting the sweet maltiness. This beer strikes me as a more complex example of the Dunkelweizen style. I found it to be very nice, a more robust beer than a hefeweizen, but with more character and spiciness than an Octoberfest. For the BJCP style ""dunkelwiezen"", I'd give this a 4.9 out of 5. Pretty much a primo example of the style.",4.5,4.5,4.0,4.5,Grozet Gooseberry & Wheat Ale,244,5,Scottish Gruit / Ancient Herbed Ale,"This is a gooseberry and wheat ale. The label gives us a little history lesson about 16th century Scottish brewing. This beer is a ""special concoction of malts, wild spices and ripe gooseberries"". First off, I don't know what a gooseberry tastes or smells like; furthermore, I don't know much about bog myrtle or meadowsweet either, which are all listed in the ingredients list along with the hops, malted barley and wheat. Nevertheless, the beer itself poured into a nice orange-yellow liquid with some cloudiness (as warned on the label). The head was nice and white, not terribly long-lived but decent. The aroma has a faint cereal note along with some floral hints and a touch of spiciness, which seems to me like a cross between fresh hay and Eastern spices (maybe cumin or curry?) The flavor is smooth, rather drinkable with some slightly tart notes that reminds me of granny smith apple, blended with slightly sweet malt and light bitterness at the end for balance. The spices are nicely blended and strike me as being somewhat secretive - I don't taste and smell the spices as a dominant note, but I can tell they are there. In this mode, these unusual ingrediants compliment the beer and function much as flavor and aroma hops (and specialty grains) do in 'regular' beers. I rather enjoyed this and I think it would be good for many occaisions, and although it doesn't blow me away, I think it is a very accessible beer without being bland and insipid.

I just sampled the newest batch of this brew and I think Tremont has come pretty damn close to the original. It doesn't seem quite as hoppy to me, but it's actually a rather pleasant change from the hop monster brews. Very nicely balanced with a big malt backbone, and the hops asserting their presence, but not overwhelming the beer. Tremont has always brewed English style beers, so it's no surprise that they're IPA doesn't resemble an American IPA. Instead, they're producing a solid, tasty beer that satisfies without being over the top. It definitely gets my seal of approval :) === My previous review from 2001: This batch of Tremont no longer has the ""Brewed in Boston"" on the label, so my guess is that it's a contract brewed batch. This has always been my favorite IPA, but something is missing since they've changed to a contract brewer. The mouthfeel is thinner, the beer is much clearer, and all the things that I loved about this beer seem somewhat subdued, especially the hoppiness. It has a fruitier profile to it that I don't recall in the original. It's still a good beer, but it used to be an excellent beer. There's also a metallic overtone in the taste that wasn't there before. I've been drinking Tremont IPA for years and everytime it always strikes me how delicious it is .. that feeling is gone with this batch. What a bummer, I hope they return back to their original brewing method soon. Update - 7/2/2002. Chris Lohring mentioned a while ago that they weren't happy with the conversion of the Tremont IPA to the contract brew process. He said that they will be coming out with a reformulated version of the IPA around July, but I haven't heard anything more about it. The original Tremont IPA was superb, so I'm hoping they work out the bugs and get close to the original once again. Cheers",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,-1.0,,-1.0

I just sampled the newest batch of this brew and I think Tremont has come pretty damn close to the original. It doesn't seem quite as hoppy to me, but it's actually a rather pleasant change from the hop monster brews. Very nicely balanced with a big malt backbone, and the hops asserting their presence, but not overwhelming the beer. Tremont has always brewed English style beers, so it's no surprise that they're IPA doesn't resemble an American IPA. Instead, they're producing a solid, tasty beer that satisfies without being over the top.

A perfect half-centimeter head remains through to the bottom of the glass&#8230;begging you to pour another, so that it may have another pint to ride down the glass.The aroma is predominantly floral / grassy - quite inviting.

luvnd,Brutal Bitter Ale,361,5.8,American IPA,"Pres: 22oz bomber collector's bottle Appearance: Copper color with significant chill haze. Head is short lived and thin. Smell: Hop oil essence! Very pleasing. Reminds me a bit of Sierra Nevada Celebration. Taste: Way bitter, but a nice malt backbone. Bitterness remains long after the swallow, but is not unpleasant. A little heavy on the hop for what I expect from an ESB/strong bitter. Mouthfeel: Nice. Good level of carbonation. Very smooth, full, but not overly dense. Drinkability: A 22oz bottle is perfect. 12 wouldn't be enough, but more than this may put you on hop overload, depending on your tolerance. The strong bitter aftertaste, though not unpleasant, limits the amount you can drink. Overall: Another stellar offering from a great brewery.",3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,Dreadnaught IPA,1558,9.5,American Double / Imperial IPA,"Pres: 650 cc bottle with insane looking British officer and an assassin lurking in the background Appearance: Copper, like the color of fermentation tanks. 1-2 fingers thick, sticky head. Clings to the glass. Very clear, no haze at all with a careful pour. Smell: Man alive, I feel like I just opened a bag of fresh hops and dove in for a whiff. I half expect to see little yellow lupulin sacks floating in it. Piney, sharp cheddar. Beautiful. Taste: Fantastic. Fresh hop, long, lingering bitter aftertaste, but not that ""overhopped"", out of balance flavor that a lot of these double IPA's are afflicted with. The best word for the overall taste is harmony between hop character and malt sweetness. I don't get a hint of alcohol, which is scarey. Mouthfeel: Creamy and smooth, too easy for the alleged 9.5% Drikability: Again, too easy. This just goes down and feels good.

Unfortunately, to prove this point I have to sift through the majority of cheap beer that tastes like ass. Josef Hoffbauer Ice is no exception. This beer tastes like it was composed of malt and twice as much sugar as should have been added. The result: a thinly tasting beer that is as sweet as maple syrup. It has the amazing ability to stick on your taste buds for 10 minutes after you last sip reminding you of the mistake you'd just made.

A smooth, coated, gold foil covers the top of the bottle and the cap. The pour reveals a nice hazy orange beer with a fabulous aroma.

Personally, I find the infusion of the northwestern hops and the citrusy wheat style to be a bit jarring. During the summer months, I do periodically enjoy Bell's Oberon which is in this style. The beer itself, as I had it, was served in a fun bottle with Widmer's logo (?) raised in the glass of the bottle. The beer poured beautifully and had a beautiful golden color which is moderately translucent at most. Very nicely cloudy. The taste was clearly that of an Americanized wheat beer -- more or less what you'd expect: citrus, wheat, some yeast flavor at the end. Very simple but refreshing. I prefer Oberon if I'm going to drink this style, but I have a few more of these in my fridge that I'll clearly be consuming in the future.",4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,Florisgaarden Passion,4933,3,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,"Wow.

mitchster,Bell's Harry Magill's Spiced Stout,2133,2025-09-07 00:00:00,American Double / Imperial Stout,"Pours an oily black with little to no translucency and clumps of flocculant yeast settling quickly to the bottom. Forms a small dark tan head (despite a vigorous pour) which quickly thins (but sticks around for the finish), and leaves very sparse brussels lace. Mild carbonation. Aroma is that of smoke, relish, deeply roasted grains, dark chocolate, black walnut, peppery alcohol, and very faint cinnamon and nutmeg. For aroma, think rauchbier meets Kalamazoo Stout. I get the faint hint of nutmeg, anise and cinnamon in taste. The spices are very subtle at first, but become more pronounced over time. Initial taste is dark malts, dark coffee, nutmeg and cinnamon, peppery alcohol, a subtle sourness, sweet malts, and mild bittering hops with an oily body and big mouthfeel. Finish is that of sweet grain and is somewhat rubbery. Hops are there just enough to complement the malt. A 6-month old sample has less sourness and more spice character, as well as more noticeable alcohol. Overall, this is an enjoyable and unique beer, but I can't see myself drinking more than 2 of these.

naerhu,Sapporo Original Draft Beer,827,5,Japanese Rice Lager,"Ingredients: malts, hops, rice, corn, starch. 5% Alcohol. In Japan this is called Sapporo Black Label, I do not know why it is referred to as original draft beer on this site, unless that is the English name for this. This is an exceedingly average beer, but life is too short for average. It has no aroma to speak of, a head that disappeared so fast, I was not sure if it was ever there. It had the sharp initial karakuchi impact and corn-flavors on the palate. Corn flavor also detected by my Japanese wife who was blind tasting the beer with me. No lasting flavor. Nothing wrong with this beer, but nothing right about it either, except that such a sharp impact, which is extremely important and universal in Japanese beers. Such an impact is extremely refreshing.

When I smelled the beer I immediately picked up on the scent of cloves, the other two prominent scents were that of bing cherries and hops. Upon tasting the beer I realized that I had initially been fooled by it's interesting scent. The lager tasted stale, almost reminiscent of day old, very weak, coffee. And, a prominent almost overwhelming taste of yeast practically slapped me in the face. However, I still sensed some of that bing cherry. The brew was crisp in my mouth, but very thin, leaving an unpleasant aftertaste. I really would not be able to drink more than one of these beers in a single time frame.

A little hazy, but it seemed to clear up as it went along. Nice 1"" head, white, that lasted quite a while. After it dissappated, all I had to do was swirl the glass slightly and it was back. Nice lacing down the side of the glass as well. Smell: Hops hops and more hops. Overwhelmingly hoppy in the smell. Maybe some citrus and a mild malt profile, but thin compared to the hops. Taste: Much more balanced than I expected from the smell. There is definately an overwhelming amount of hops, but a nice grassy malt flavor blends in nicely from behind. Smoother than I expected as well. Bitter, but that's what you'd expect. It's a beer that bites you back. The malt charactoristics really show in the aftertaste, but even there, you can taste the hops, and it lingers forever. I'm sitting here savoring the aftertaste and I finished it about 5 minutes ago. Yummy. Lots of flavor there, just hard to define. Mouthfeel: Crisp. Very crisp. Not too thin, but not overwhelmingly thick or oily. Nice and clean. Drinkability: Started out rather nice, but by the end of the bottle, it was getting a little hard to continue. Not that it's bad, but the bitterness really is strong as it starts to warm up. I spent a good 45 minutes drinking this. Just sipping it and enjoying the silence of children in bed and the wife at the gem. Me and sportscenter and Stone I.P.A. Not bad. Props to a Jeremy, a friend of mine, for meeting me at the lake with this, Arrogant Bastard, 1554 Black Ale, and Porch Swing (reviews pending). I can't get any of them in Oklahoma, so I have to rely on other methods. Also, he just gave them to me. Gotta love free beer. This one, bitter, full of hops, but balanced. Could definately drink again, and will, but it's not something I could drink tons of in one sitting. One is enough for one night. Overall, impressed, especially since this is my first Stone brew to try, looking forward to cracking open that Arrogant Bastard this weekend.",4.5,4.0,4.5,4.5,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

nytemare,Chocolate Stout,1118,6,American Stout,"Appearance: This brew poured a dark, dark brown with a beautiful tan head that took quite some time to dissipate. Smell: Sticking my nose over the rim of this glass was a pleasure. I got a nose full of roasted malt and nice dark chocolate. Delightful. Taste: Even better than it smelled. A nice front of hops followed by an exceptional roasted malt and chocolate flavor that lingered for while. Delicious. Mouthfeel: Seemed full bodied compared to most beers I drink. Was smooth and creamy. Drinkability: As I told my wife, I could drink this quite often. Easy to drink. Overall I was impressed. I've had several Rogue beers now and have liked all of them, including the Hazelnut Brown Nectar and Dead Guy, but this one blew me away. Definately a beer first, but the chocolate flavor is definately there. Thanx to Liquid Solutions for this one, had to order it because I can't find it anywhere around me.

If held up to a light you could get a little bit through it. Nice tan head about 3/4"" that held quite well. Lasted almost halfway through the brew.

Nice 1"" head, white, that lasted quite a while. After it dissappated, all I had to do was swirl the glass slightly and it was back. Nice lacing down the side of the glass as well. Smell: Hops hops and more hops. Overwhelmingly hoppy in the smell. Maybe some citrus and a mild malt profile, but thin compared to the hops. Taste: Much more balanced than I expected from the smell. There is definately an overwhelming amount of hops, but a nice grassy malt flavor blends in nicely from behind. Smoother than I expected as well. Bitter, but that's what you'd expect. It's a beer that bites you back. The malt charactoristics really show in the aftertaste, but even there, you can taste the hops, and it lingers forever. I'm sitting here savoring the aftertaste and I finished it about 5 minutes ago. Yummy. Lots of flavor there, just hard to define. Mouthfeel: Crisp. Very crisp. Not too thin, but not overwhelmingly thick or oily. Nice and clean. Drinkability: Started out rather nice, but by the end of the bottle, it was getting a little hard to continue. Not that it's bad, but the bitterness really is strong as it starts to warm up. I spent a good 45 minutes drinking this. Just sipping it and enjoying the silence of children in bed and the wife at the gem. Me and sportscenter and Stone I.P.A. Not bad.

I can't get any of them in Oklahoma, so I have to rely on other methods. Also, he just gave them to me. Gotta love free beer. This one, bitter, full of hops, but balanced.

Their Barley Wine (style) Ale provides an inviting appearance with a robust brown color featuring ruddy highlights, as well as a complex aroma that includes scents of pepper and orange. An odd scent, which transcends as hoppiness in the flavor, is probably attributed to the high alcohol content that comes off in its scent and amalgamates into the bitterness of its taste. Therefore, the taste would probably be improved by a long and intense breathing session or storage alone, as many advocates have suggested.

Their Barley Wine (style) Ale provides an inviting appearance with a robust brown color featuring ruddy highlights, as well as a complex aroma that includes scents of pepper and orange. An odd scent, which transcends as hoppiness in the flavor, is probably attributed to the high alcohol content that comes off in its scent and amalgamates into the bitterness of its taste. Therefore, the taste would probably be improved by a long and intense breathing session or storage alone, as many advocates have suggested.

padjo1,McEwan's Scotch Ale,1275,8,Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy,"In presenting this review it would assist the reader to know that this is the first of the Scotch Ale style I have tried. Being a resident of the southwest coast of the USA, (Southern California for the geographically challenged), one doesn't have as many opportunities to have a go at this reputable category. Appearance: Dark brown, an auburn when held up to the light. Nice billowy head that leaves a white lace throughout. Smell: MALT, fruit underneath (orange peel, figs, raisins or currants), and delicate spice (cinnamon, cloves, and perhaps nutmeg and just a little bit of coriander). Taste: Very malty with hints of molasses. Not much chocolate. Mouthfeel: Thick and chewy. High gravity. Drinkability: High points are given to the complexity. Can't drink tooo much of this beer. It's just too heavy. That's not a bad thing though. The alcohol is a little overdone.

So you might be able to imagine how excited I was to find a beer produced by this brewery that I had only read about. Here is my review which was sidelined by my subjective enthusiam, so I beseech the reader to add an impartial objectivity. Boldly stated, this was something of a disappointment. The appearence is an orange, cloudy substance that retains quite a bit of a pleasant foam that is balanced by a mediocre bouquet that can be compared to sniffing a Chimay Grande Reserve through a coffee filter. Its taste is nothing to gawk at but it is noticable that its true potnetial has been undercut by commercial imperatives. The slightly creamy mouthfeel is rounded- out nicely by the sharp interruption of its dryness. Overall this is an enjoyable specimen that either suit the likes of the Belgian White Ale amatuer or that of the aficionado that never cared much for the style whatsoever.

popsinc,La Terrible,3635,2025-05-10 00:00:00,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,"Aged 1 year before opening Aug 10/03........ Appearance: 750ml corked bottle. A very dark brown, almost black, pour with a huge tan head that holds up well. Plenty of active carbonation as well. Smell: Malty and sweet. Dark raisiny-sweet nose with raw sugar hints throughout. Just a touch of light maple syrup. Taste: Dry and malty off the top. The taste quickly turns towards a dark fruit sweetness highlighted by raisin and plum. Moderate spiciness and an obvious alcohol kick. Plenty of body and complexity. The finish is very warm and reminds me very much of a nice port or sherry. Mouthfeel: Dry off the top and very full.

It is a beer that has to be served real cold and cannot be left to get warm. If in Boston try the Bell In Hand house brew.You will not be disappointed! This is not an E & O Trading Co. brew..

The nose hits you with a burst of freshly ground cardamom and a slight hint of lemon and citrus. The color is a very light gold, with little to no head, but fine, tight bubbles. The flavor can only be described as exotic. You get some of the cardamom and citrus that you find on the nose, but there is also a slightly fruity character similar to star fruit, or perhaps papaya.

There was no yeast in my glass untill I poured the last 25% into my half empty glass. Chilling helps lock the yeast down and you can decant slowly and let it come up to temp in the glass w/ out the unsightly (but healthfull!) yeast floaters.

Not bottle conditioned, (ie no yeast )but cellarable, I'm sure the 11.5% alc / vol ensures it's longevity, but I question whether the flavors change.We will see in time. The condition of this bottle was near perfect. Dense and clingy, slighlty off white head, mega malt to start but fresh earthy hop aroma fights it's way through around the alcohol notes. Label states only ""the choicest East Kent Goldings"" hops are used. This Brarley wine is as close to a US / W. coast barleywine ( more malt than Ol Crusty, more Hop than Ol Foghorn..)as I've ever tasted from the UK. This beer explodes w/ hopflavor and bitterness - all EK Golding grassiness and fruity pine. Massive amounts of malt must be used in this brew and much remains in the sweet, honey like , full bodied flavors that stack up to the uncommonly strong hop presence. As this beer warmed the alcohol notes came through a bit more ; but only a bit as the thickness and hoppiness hide the alcohol very well. If there were dyacitals and funky alcohol flavors, I couldnt find them. The warmth down the throat and into your veins keeps you aware of the Hugeness of what your sipping. This is without a doubt the best British barleywine Ive ever had and quite possibly one of the best made beers. Aged before release, exceptionally well balanced, Humongously Massive in every way... as the bottle states this beer is brewed "" as a Celebration of the Brewers Art"". IMHO, I think JW Lees has done just that.",4.5,5.0,4.5,5.0,0.0,-1.0,1.0,0.0

taez555,Rare Vos (Amber Ale),593,2025-05-06 00:00:00,Belgian Pale Ale,"Tried this beer in the 750ml corked bottle. This beer poured a nice thick white head that took a few minutes die down. The color was a hazy opaque brownish/amber. The nose was amazing. hints of fruit, plums, raisons, apples, yeast, with a few earthy woody notes. The initial taste on the other hand was rather disapointing compared to the nose. Rather bland, a mellow woody apple almost cider quality that was overshadowed by it's bitterness. The more I tasted this beer, it just kept coming up the same. A very complex light flavor that was just slightly overshadowed by it's bitterness. It seems this beer might be improved by 6 months or so of aging to mellow it out a little. The finish was short. A few spice notes and the subtle bitterness were all that lingered. Compared to the other beers by ommengang I was a little let down by this beer. If you gave me a blind taste test of this beer next to a real belgian I havn't had yet I'd be hard pressed to tell which one was the American beer. It's an excellent belgian attempt. Ommengang stands alone in US belgian style beers, but this beer just fell a little short in my opinion. I might get another bottle and let it age for a while before trying it again.",4.0,5.0,4.0,3.5,Golden Monkey,1003,2025-05-09 00:00:00,Tripel,"Golden Monkey, an american made belgian trippel on a budget. This beer was bottled 1/10/03. I poured it into my standard snifter and let it build a nice white/beige head that died down rather quickly. It never completly went away. The body was a very clear orange which caught me a little off guard. It almost resembled a macro brew for how clear it was. Odd to see a belgian style ale of higher quality without the yeast sediment. The nose was very inviting. Fruity with some yeasty smells that were almost reminisent of a mix between duvel and some lighter sam adams. The taste was very well balanced with hints of pears, apples, some spices and bitterness. I swear after a while I could taste some hints of corn or rice, with almost a chalky flavor. It reminded me yet again of some of the macro beers. This beer finished rather nicely. The taste lingered for a little while with some spice and bitter notes. Overall I have mixed feels about this beer. It's deffinatly a step above psuedo U.S. belgian styles like blue moon.

The stout poured beautifully to give a very dark black/brown beverage with a nice light brown, long lasting head that clung to the glass as I drank it. I found this to be exceptional for a bottled stout. The smell was very nice with a strong carmelized barley aroma with hints of licorice. The aroma was evident with each sip. The taste was very strong, and it almost jumped off the tongue, with a strong, sharp heavily roasted barley flavor, very slight sweetness, and some nice hoppiness in the long-lingering aftertaste. The slight taste of alcohol was detectable in this strong brew. The mouthfeel was sharp and full bodied, but smooth. As for drinkability, this stout is quite good, but because it is 9.1% abv, I hesitate to give it the highest score in this category.
