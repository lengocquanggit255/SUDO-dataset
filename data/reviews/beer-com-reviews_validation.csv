The fullness of the mouthfeel is enhanced by a slightly sweet, and yet somewhat sour start that ends on a pleasantly bitter note. As it warms a bit, the flavoring builds strength; either cool or warm the great taste lingers long and strong. A warming brew that you can stick with all evening.

Mild start with a very hoppy, crisp and almost acidic finish which makes it almost like an IPA but not quite there. The bitterness put meoff a little at first but now I am an avid fan. Though some do not like the crispness, I think it makes the beer. Perfect for a summer afternoon. Light enough you can go a full night on it but heavy enough for sipping. It is now brewed in Ukiah, CA but the original brewpub is in Hopland, CA. With a home town by that name it has to be good. The brewpub is great, welcoming to tourists but with a hometown following. One of the regulars even has his own chair at the bar, complete with a plaque. If you are ever cruising up the 101, drop by, you will not be disappointed.",4.0,3.5,3.0,4.5,1.0,,0.0,1.0

There is a very nice painting of a castle and lake on the front. The beer poured a hazy yellow with a good level of carbonation and a generous light and fluffy head with great lace retention. The smell was dominantly yeasty, so there were hints of citrus fruit and spices. The taste reflected the smell, well balanced and light, neither the fruit nor spice flavor was dominant, but still for some reason it tasted a bit bland to me. Though, still very crisp and refreshing with a smooth finish. We had no problem finishing this little cask, but no doubt I would have enjoyed this more had it been July instead of March. Overall this was a solid white beer, but not the best I?ve had, and definitely not the best Unibroue has to offer.",4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,0.0,0.0,-1.0,1.0

The carbonation level was just about right to produce a good level of head after a slightly vigorous pour, and lace remained for quite a while. The smell was pure hops. There may have been more complex smells there as well, but I was too happy inhaling the hops aroma to notice. The taste was mostly hoppy with a bit of sweet malt to balance. The taste buds were awakened nicely by the hop bitterness, yet it all finished very smoothly. Overall this is a very good IPA, and if you are a hophead you will love it.

crotor,Anchor Liberty Ale,665,6,American Pale Ale (APA),"I'd been pleased with every Anchor offering thus far, and they delivered again. It poured with a substantial head, but the retention was rather low. The dark gold color made for a nice appearance. The hopping and maltiness were apparent in the aroma, though both rather low...

A really filling beer with loads of taste. I was given one these once in college and it was my introduction to the world of quality stouts. It's still one of my favorites. A great beer from one of the country's best breweries.",4.0,4.5,4.0,4.5,0.0,1.0,,-1.0
derkaiser,Ommegang (Abbey Ale),142,2025-05-08 00:00:00,Dubbel,"750ml. bottle, corked and caged. This tarnished copper colored brew caps itself with a medium (finger and a half) sized head. Wow, the smell is evident at least 18-inches from the nose. And what a smell! Bananas Foster hits the nail on the head (if you're familiar with that dessert). Taste: again bananas, thick sugars, and mild spices present themselves immediately to the tongue. If it ended there I'd be happy, but I keep picking up an annoyingly bitter finish that keeps me from giving this beer as high of rating as I'd like to. Still, at $5 a bottle, I'll be back.",4.0,5.0,4.5,3.5,McEwan's Scotch Ale,1275,8,Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy,"I'll have to admit, my ability to gauge scotch ales has been forever skewed after I had an absolutely spectacular version at the Steelhead Brewery in Burlingame, CA. McEwan's isn't even in the same ballpark (hell, it's not even the same sport), but it's still a fairly good beer. A nice mahogany color, it pours into a one-finger head that soon dissipates, but leaves some lace all the way down. The flavor is dominated by a malty sweetness that hangs around all the way through the finish. Warming alcohol notes quickly flow through mouth and nose. This is definitely a big beer but, as others have noted, it's just not very complex. And the $10.50 per six pack price pretty much precludes me from coming back. P.S. Four or five of these, and you won't remember what youre drinking.",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,-1.0,1.0,,0.0

My favorite regional.,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.5,Dergy's Honey Blonde Ale,5169,5.5,American Blonde Ale,"Not one of my favorites. Pours yellow golden with small white head. Has a slight sweet herbal nose.

When I *really* reach, I can imagine some maple flavour in there too. The mouthfeel is nonexistant, roughly equivalent to water. As I near finishing this bottle, a grain flavour builds in the background. All told, this is a very disappointing beer.

Its label says it is a cross between stout and lager, but it was not as pleasing and much too sweet, as opposed to some B&T I have had. The pour was dark and decent with a fair sized head which disappeared rather quickly. The taste however was not to my liking. It tasted watered down with very few flavors that stayed in my mouth for very long. And there was no bitterness to speak of! Overall not a very complex beer that only made me thirsty for a better one.",3.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,-1.0,,,1.0

mainebeerman,Franziskaner Hefe-Weisse,1946,5,Hefeweizen,"The weissens and in particular the hefe-weissens were some of my favorites during my time in Germany. Over there they used to serve them in the tall weissen glasses with a lemon slice floated on top and a few grains of rice at the bottom to induce an alka-seltzer like action that helped keep the head on the beer. I left the lemon out generally, but you may want to try it this fashion as it is rather refreshing, especially in the summer months. This beer poured a cloudy yellow orange yellow with a huge head of white foam. A 1/4 inch layer of foam stayed for most of the glass, probably due to the above mentioned rice. The aroma of a weissen is something I can recognize instantly. I seem to recall reading somewhere that this rather unique aroma was due to the presence of both the wheat used in brewing and a special variety of yeast. The smell is yeasty with a mix of banana, orange and clove essences. Creamy, refreshing flavor with some caramel sweetness balanced by some rather citrusy (hop?) flavor. Carbonation leads to a club soda mouthfeel at the start, but the finish tapers off to banana, spice and yeast with a rather dry feel. Decent, drinkable beer, great in the summer and a fair example of the style although I have had better and fresher in Germany.

Reminded me of my grandmother's wheat bread dough before it hit the oven. Rich full bodied flavor, very creamy but seemed a bit overcarbonated.

saunaking,Beck's,2435,5,German Pilsener,"What can I say? I really like this beer - its one of my favorites. It has a light, golden colour and pours a light, thin head that is pretty quick to dissipate. Beck's emits a nice, mild aroma that is not at all overpoweing, in fact you really have to enjoy it when you open the beer and pour it because, like the head it does not linger and is harder to notice after the beer has been opened and poured. I'm no beer tasting expert so its hard for me to say what it smells like, maybe barley or wheat or some kind of grain but it certainly smells like what a pilsner should smell like. For me, the best part of this beer is the taste. It is light and hoppy with a very clean finish. A smooth beer that goes down easy and a slightly bitter aftertaste. As you can tell, I like this beer very much. I have seen it compared to Heiniken, but in my opinion it is far superior (not really saying much) and is not really a fair comparasion. The comparasion is probably because they are two of the most popular pilsners in the world. I like this beer quite cold, maybe colder than experts would recommend - I often take it from the fridge to the freezer for 5 to 10 minutes before I drink it (maybe because my fridge should be colder) and in the summer it has to be in a cooler full of ice. Very nice crisp taste and the bitter aftertaste is really pleasant so you know you are drinking a beer. Beck's isn't too 'bubbly' but the carbonation is there because I get great beer burps even during my 1st one. A solid all round beer, great with food and without. I like mine out of the 500mL cans (yep, cans) because its a great value that way (here in Canada anyways) and tastes better to me than served from the bottles.

saunaking,Beck's,2435,5,German Pilsener,"What can I say? I really like this beer - its one of my favorites. It has a light, golden colour and pours a light, thin head that is pretty quick to dissipate. Beck's emits a nice, mild aroma that is not at all overpoweing, in fact you really have to enjoy it when you open the beer and pour it because, like the head it does not linger and is harder to notice after the beer has been opened and poured. I'm no beer tasting expert so its hard for me to say what it smells like, maybe barley or wheat or some kind of grain but it certainly smells like what a pilsner should smell like. For me, the best part of this beer is the taste. It is light and hoppy with a very clean finish. A smooth beer that goes down easy and a slightly bitter aftertaste. As you can tell, I like this beer very much. I have seen it compared to Heiniken, but in my opinion it is far superior (not really saying much) and is not really a fair comparasion. The comparasion is probably because they are two of the most popular pilsners in the world. I like this beer quite cold, maybe colder than experts would recommend - I often take it from the fridge to the freezer for 5 to 10 minutes before I drink it (maybe because my fridge should be colder) and in the summer it has to be in a cooler full of ice. Very nice crisp taste and the bitter aftertaste is really pleasant so you know you are drinking a beer. Beck's isn't too 'bubbly' but the carbonation is there because I get great beer burps even during my 1st one. A solid all round beer, great with food and without. I like mine out of the 500mL cans (yep, cans) because its a great value that way (here in Canada anyways) and tastes better to me than served from the bottles.

stevep,Le Coq Imperial Extra Double Stout,438,10,Russian Imperial Stout,"As with IPA, Imperial Stout developed its strong flavours in order to survive long journeys. During the 18th century reign of Porter, the stronger (""stout"") version was exported to the Baltic region. It was given extra hops and a higher abv in order to survive the journey. A Belgian, A Le Coq, was the man in charge of these exports. Thrales Anchor Brewery Entire (the contemporary name for Porter) was the one chosen by A Le Coq to send to the Empress of Russia. The brewery was eventually bought by Barclay Perkins, and then in 1955 by Courage. The Courage Imperial Stout is rarely made these days - it hasn't been brewed since the 1990's, and may never be made again. Bottles that do exist can fetch high prices. However, A Le Coq was also responsible for another Imperial Stout that does still exist. Because of the high import duties on the beer, A Le Coq had arranged to have a version brewed within Russia. Brewing began in 1912 in what is now Estonia. After a few ups and downs brewing of this famous Stout ceased in 1969. However, during the 1990's, when it became clear that production of the Courage Imperial Stout had ceased, the Lewes brewery Harvey & Son, with the supervision of the Estonia brewery, revived A Le Coq's Imperial Extra Double Stout. Only brewed once a year, and then allowed to age for a couple of years before being released, this is the only authentic Imperial Stout still being made (Sam Smith's version is not bottle conditioned, and is too low in abv to qualify). The 2001 edition is now available. It has a Flemish nose: oaky mature balsamic vinegar and minced pies. The mouthfeel is slightly rough and heavy. There are flavours of soy sauce, chocolate, port, ripe plums and wine soaked oak. There is a long, dry finish. It feels old which flatters the mouth into believing this is a beer of distinction. The roughness and imbalance suggests that this is a little young to be drunk right now. The 2000 edition however was much smoother. The plums were fresh tasting, there were also fresh figs, and the chocolate was finest Belgian mixed with prune juice. A huge, complex and divine brew. When compared with other Imperial Stouts (Sam Smith's, Old Chimney's Good King Henry or Bell's Expedition Stout) Harvey's comes out a very close winner to Good King Henry, but does show up Bell's and Sam Smith's for the court jesters they are.

The front label had 3.5% abv, but the back label had 4.75%. Chapeau's label is green & brown with a picture of a beer barrel draped with hops and barley - Lindeman's is much more attractive: all black with stylish art deco white lettering. On opening the Lindeman's had more fizz and an immediate strong plummy aroma. Both settle to a brown copper colour with a fringe of bubbly froth - the Lindeman's bubbles slightly larger and more varied. So far the Lindeman's is ahead. On giving both a good sniff the Chapeau edges ahead with its musty sweet aroma, slightly medicinal, slightly licorice, quite perfumey - parma violets; when swirled extra sweetness rises. The Lindeman's has a slight plum aroma; when swirled some yeasty lambic acid rises. On tasting the Chapeau is the more interesting with its sweet and medicinal taste, followed by a soft sweet licorice flavour at the back. However, it flags slightly when the band aid remains in the mouth along with a cloying, clinging sweey coating of the mouth. The Lindeman's is much simpler, and more direct. It is intensely sweet initially, but that soon settles into a balance between sweetness and acidity. The mouthfeel really pushes the Lindeman's into first place. Chapeau has a soft mouthfeel with a barely noticable and soon gone gentle fizz - quite boring. The Lindeman's however has a soft fizzy mothfeel - very gentle like having baby rabbits tickle your mouth. Weee! The conclusion is that Chapeau is a flavoursome and interesting drink, but lacks the fun of Lindeman's despite the fuller and more complex flavours.",3.0,4.0,2.0,3.5,,,1.0,1.0

stevep,Le Coq Imperial Extra Double Stout,438,10,Russian Imperial Stout,"As with IPA, Imperial Stout developed its strong flavours in order to survive long journeys. During the 18th century reign of Porter, the stronger (""stout"") version was exported to the Baltic region. It was given extra hops and a higher abv in order to survive the journey. A Belgian, A Le Coq, was the man in charge of these exports. Thrales Anchor Brewery Entire (the contemporary name for Porter) was the one chosen by A Le Coq to send to the Empress of Russia. The brewery was eventually bought by Barclay Perkins, and then in 1955 by Courage. The Courage Imperial Stout is rarely made these days - it hasn't been brewed since the 1990's, and may never be made again. Bottles that do exist can fetch high prices. However, A Le Coq was also responsible for another Imperial Stout that does still exist. Because of the high import duties on the beer, A Le Coq had arranged to have a version brewed within Russia. Brewing began in 1912 in what is now Estonia. After a few ups and downs brewing of this famous Stout ceased in 1969. However, during the 1990's, when it became clear that production of the Courage Imperial Stout had ceased, the Lewes brewery Harvey & Son, with the supervision of the Estonia brewery, revived A Le Coq's Imperial Extra Double Stout. Only brewed once a year, and then allowed to age for a couple of years before being released, this is the only authentic Imperial Stout still being made (Sam Smith's version is not bottle conditioned, and is too low in abv to qualify). The 2001 edition is now available. It has a Flemish nose: oaky mature balsamic vinegar and minced pies. The mouthfeel is slightly rough and heavy. There are flavours of soy sauce, chocolate, port, ripe plums and wine soaked oak. There is a long, dry finish. It feels old which flatters the mouth into believing this is a beer of distinction. The roughness and imbalance suggests that this is a little young to be drunk right now. The 2000 edition however was much smoother. The plums were fresh tasting, there were also fresh figs, and the chocolate was finest Belgian mixed with prune juice. A huge, complex and divine brew.

A very mild taste for its style, slightly fruity, not overpowering in anyway. A definite aftertaste persists although this is neither positive or negative. Feels light, an easy drinking beer, although somewhat disappointing given both its very good appearance and smell.

The head dissipates fairly quickly and leaves behind a little lacing on the glass. A rather attractive beer in the glass. The aroma is that of burnt/roasted coffee with a hint of chocolate. Tastes very sweet and chocolatey. Feels smooth and fairly heavy in the mouth. The rather heavy feel and chocolatey sweetness (too sweet for my liking) certainly acted to limit my consumption of this beer--I felt as though I had eaten too much dessert in finishing my glass.",4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,Alpha King Pale Ale,39,6,American Pale Ale (APA),"Pours a dark coppery color, nice foamy white head. Lacing on glass as head dissipates. Lacing persists as beer is consumed as does a very thin head. A very attractive beer. Smells of citrus and hops, not overpowering but very pleasant. Decent taste, hoppy with a citrus overtone. A nice feel, not very heavy. Readily drunk, a good overall beer.",4.5,4.5,3.5,4.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,-1.0

I got sick of trying to find something that I wasn't entirely sure existed, so up the bottle went. Not too bad. Better than I expected. Nice carbonation. No hop presence. A slight maltiness, but mainly the honey taste. I could imagine this being popular with non-beer drinkers. I guess the honey was pleasant, but my two pals malt and hops must not visit St. Louis much. The aftertaste revealed nothing new, but I'm still wondering if any hops are hiding in the bottle? An IBU or two would find spacious living. I think they used one pellet per batch. Entirely inoffensive. I doubt I'll drink this again, save an emergency. Sorry,Honey Lager. Good hustle, but I don't think you made the team.",1.5,1.5,3.0,2.0,DeGroen's Weizen,3651,4.9,Hefeweizen,"This is no american hefeweisen. Flavor abounds here.

unionmade,McNeill's Yukon Gold,5349,4.9,American Blonde Ale,"A canadian style beer? That's unusual. Pours a pale gold color, with a very frothy white head.

Aroma of this beer fulfilling by itself, but after tasting this malty treat I was truly fulfilled with pleasure. For the mouthful that each sip delivers it presents a heavy caramel, sweet plum, at the same time a pleasant driness if that makes sense. A very complex, but at the same time extraordinary offering that stands up to all standards of a great double bock. After how drinkable it was on tap, I can't wait to try it in a bottle to compare.",4.5,4.0,5.0,4.5,Xingu Black Beer,1314,4.7,Schwarzbier,"This rare find is one that is so unique that I can only compare to that of a brazilian beauty. The dark chocolate roasts are present along with a nut flavor that makes this beer so smooth and refreshing. The best way to characterize this beer is that it has the body of a porter with the taste of a nice oatmeal stout. As my warm hand slowly grasped the sweaty bottle of Xingu, I inquisitively peered at the mysterious Brazilian brew. Pouring its contents into my pint glass, I cautiously approached the mouth of my pint glass as if I was standing at the mouth of the Amazon River. I was now ready to let my tongue dance the samba with this dark beer that provided a copious amount of intrigue to its tasters. Like a fine Brazilian beauty, Xingus dark body was sensual and satisfying to the eyes and the tastes buds. A smooth dark roasted malt flavor finishes the flavor of this beer to create pure enjoyment.",4.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,-1.0,,0.0,0.0

This one was poured with a nice head, and it appeared with the same amber copper tone as the Hop Devil. After cleansing with some water, I began to test the aroma of the beer. Seemed mild, but as the beer warmed up the floral hops seemed to have a sweeter scent of hops. Great flavor that fulfills any hop heads desires and dreams.

Nothing is outdone here, balance of the Czech saaz hops are evident with the aroma and crisp taste.

For what it is this beer succeeds in its goal, it's a refreshing, drinkable beer that is enjoyable, but overall not too complex in any way.
